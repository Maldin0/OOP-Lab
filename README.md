## "Plese consider do it yourself before copying it"
As you can see the .idea directory  
I included it because I use the IntelliJ IDEA  
so when you clone the repo you can open it as project on IntelliJ IDEA  
\
\
the code is in the src directory  
if you only want the code delete the first line  
be careful because some files are composite  

## Q&A
Q: Why don't write a better README.md?  
A: Wow, you are here not to copy, Congrats!
\
\
Q: Did you paid for the IntelliJ IDEA?\
A: No, I use the JetBrain Educational.
